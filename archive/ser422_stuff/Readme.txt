The revised SER421 is using some elements of SER422 as SER422 has been removed from the curriculum as of
2022 and will no longer be offered. Some interesting stuff from 422 will not be in 421 simply due to time
constraints, but I am copying the code over here as it provides some places you may want to start if you
are looking to extend your knowledge from 421, especially on the server-side. Email/Slack me if you have any
questions on getting it going and I'll try to help!
