<h1 style="color: blue;">An Overview of CSS</h1>
<h3>Note from Dr. Gary</h3>
<p><em>
  Dr. Charles "Chuck" Severance of the University of Michigan is an old friend and has put together some great content for the Web, including these examples on CSS.
  These examples cover a number of basics, though not the media queries and other elements as part of our RWD discussion. Bounding boxes are used to show 
  scope of rules applied to elements.
  <br/>
  <a href="https://www.dr-chuck.com/">Dr. Chuck</a> also has some great stuff for learning Python if that is also on your list. Thanks Dr. Chuck!</em>

We can use the <b>style=</b> attribute on HTML
tags to apply various styles to text and 
blocks of text.
</p>
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;">
The "Cascading" in CSS means that the closest
style setting (monospace) "wins" over a syle setting
(arial) that is "further away".
</p>
<p style="border-style: solid; border-color: red; border-width: 5px;">
We can put a border around a block of text.
You probably want a CSS cheat sheet handy 
or use Google to search to find CSS values.
</p>
<p>
While the <b>style</b> attribute <em>works</em>,
it leads to overly verbose HTML so it is more
typical to write CSS 
<a href="./css/rules.htm">&rArr; style rules</a> to apply
styles to many tags at once.
